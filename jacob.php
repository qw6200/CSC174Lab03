        <h1>Cat Breeds</h1>
        <h5>The Good, the Bad, and the Adorable</h5>
        <p>Cats have been domesticated and bred for thousands of years. Breeds' exact date of origin are usually a
            mystery as there is always numerous conflicting data whether from the Roman times or the Aztecs. Regardless,
            cats have been an integral part of human society since ancient times. Although there aren't many cat breeds
            like those of dogs, there are still distinct personality traits as well as physical distinctions between
            each cat breed. We will explore some of the most popular breeds (as well as those I like the most) and what
            makes them distinct but similar with one another.</p>

            <h2>British Shorthair<h2>
                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>The origins of the British Shorthair most likely date back to the first century AD, making it one
                        of the most ancient identifiable cat breeds in the world. It is thought that the invading Romans
                        initially brought Egyptian domestic cats to Great Britain; these cats then interbred with the
                        local European wildcat population. Over the centuries, their naturally isolated descendants
                        developed into distinctively large, robust cats with a short but very thick coat, the better to
                        withstand
                        conditions on their native islands. Based on artists' representations, the modern British
                        Shorthair is basically unchanged from this initial type.</p>

                    <h3>Traits</h3>
                    <p>They are an easygoing and dignified breed, not as active and playful as many but sweet-natured
                        and devoted to their owners, making them a favourite of animal trainers. They tend to be safe
                        around other pets and children since they will tolerate a fair amount of physical interaction.
                    </p>

            <h2>Maine Coon<h2>
                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>The ancestral origins of the Maine Coon are unknown — there are only speculation and folk
                        tales. One such folk tale involves Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France, who was executed
                        in 1793. The story goes that before her death, Antoinette attempted to escape France with
                        the help of Captain Samuel Clough. She loaded Clough's ship with her most prized
                        possessions, including six of her favorite Turkish Angora cats. Although she did not make it
                        to the United States, her pets safely reached the shores of Wiscasset, Maine, where they
                        bred with other short-haired breeds and developed into the modern breed of the Maine Coon.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Traits</h3>
                    <p>Maine Coons are known as the "gentle giants" and possess above-average intelligence, making
                        them relatively easy to train. They are known for being loyal to their family and
                        cautious—but not mean—around strangers, but are independent and not clingy. The Maine Coon
                        is generally not known for being a "lap cat" but their gentle disposition makes the breed
                        relaxed around dogs, other cats, and children.</p>

                    <h3>Coat Type</h3>
                    <p>Maine Coons have a longhair style coat.</p>

            <h2>Ragdoll<h2>
                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>In the 1960s, a regular, non-pedigreed, light-grey, domestic longhaired cat named
                        Josephine produced several litters of typical cats. Josephine was of a
                        Persian/Angora type and had litters sired by several unknown male Birman or
                        Burmese-like cats, one of which had the Siamese point coloration. Josephine later
                        produced kittens with a docile, placid temperament, affectionate nature, and a
                        tendency to go limp and relaxed when picked up. When a subsequent litter produced
                        more of the same, Ann Baker purchased several kittens from the owner who lived
                        behind her and, believing that she had something special, set out to create what is
                        now known as the ragdoll. The breed was selectively bred over many years for
                        desirable traits, such as large size, gentle demeanor, pointed coloration, and a
                        tendency to go limp when picked up.</p>

                    <h3>Traits</h3>
                    <p>The Ragdoll is marketed by breeders as having a docile, calm and floppy nature with
                        claims that these characteristics have been passed down from the Persian and Birman
                        breeds. Opinions vary as to whether this trait might be the result of genetic
                        mutation.</p>

                    <h3>Coat Type</h3>
