        <h1>Enemies of Rome</h1>
        <h5> The Good, the Bad, and the Adorable</h5>
        <p>Across the centuries of its existence, the Roman Empire fought against many foes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hannibal Barca was a Carthaginian general and statesmen who led a famed invasion of Italy.</li>
            <li>The Gauls were a group of Celtic peoples living mostly in what is now France, who were conquered by
                Julius Caesar.</li>
            <li>Parthia was an Eastern Empire, and one of the few foreign powers that could rival Rome's power.</li>

            <h2>Hannibal Barca<h2>
                    <h3>Basic Information</h3>
                    <p>Hannibal Barca (/ˈhænɪbəl/; 247 – 183 or 181 BC) was a general of the Phoenician-Canaanite state
                        of
                        Ancient Carthage, and is widely considered as one of the greatest military commanders in
                        history.
                        His father Hamilcar Barca was the leading Carthaginian commander during the First Punic War. His
                        younger brothers were Mago and Hasdrubal, and he was brother-in-law to Hasdrubal the Fair.</p>

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>Hannibal lived during a period of great tension in the western Mediterranean Basin, when the
                        Roman
                        Republic established its supremacy over other great powers such as ancient Carthage, the
                        Etruscans,
                        the Samnites, and the Greek kingdom of Syracuse. One of his most famous achievements was at the
                        outbreak of the Second Punic War, when he marched an army which included war elephants from
                        Iberia
                        over the Pyrenees and the Alps into Italy. In his first few years in Italy, he won dramatic
                        victories at the Trebia, Lake Trasimene, and Cannae. He distinguished himself for his ability to
                        determine his and his opponent's respective strengths and weaknesses, and to plan battles
                        accordingly. Hannibal's well-planned strategies allowed him to conquer many allies of Rome.</p>

                    <h3>Conflict with Rome</h3>
                    <p>Hannibal occupied part of southern Italy for 15 years, but was unable to march on Rome. An enemy
                        counter-invasion of North Africa forced him to return to Carthage, where he was decisively
                        defeated
                        by Scipio Africanus at the Battle of Zama. Scipio had studied Hannibal's tactics and brilliantly
                        devised some of his own, and he finally defeated Rome's nemesis at Zama, having previously
                        driven
                        Hannibal's brother Hasdrubal out of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>

            <h2>The Gauls<h2>
                    <h3>Basic Information</h3>
                    <p>The Gauls (Latin: Galli, Ancient Greek: Γαλάται, Galátai) were a group of Celtic peoples of
                        West-Central Europe in the Iron Age and the Roman period (roughly from the 5th century BC to
                        the 5th century AD). The area they inhabited was known as Gaul. Their Gaulish language forms
                        the main branch of the Continental Celtic languages.</p>

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>The Gauls emerged around the 5th century BC as the bearers of the La Tène culture north of
                        the Alps (spread across the lands between the Seine, Middle Rhine and upper Elbe). By the
                        4th century BC, they spread over much of what is now France, Belgium, Spain, Portugal,
                        Switzerland, Southern Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia by virtue of
                        controlling the trade routes along the river systems of the Rhône, Seine, Rhine, and Danube,
                        and they quickly expanded into Northern Italy, the Balkans, Transylvania and Galatia. Gaul
                        was never united under a single ruler or government, but the Gallic tribes were capable of
                        uniting their forces in large-scale military operations. They reached the peak of their
                        power in the early 3rd century BC. </p>

                    <h3>Conflict with Rome</h3>
                    <p>The rising Roman Republic after the end of the First Punic War increasingly put pressure on
                        the Gallic sphere of influence; the Battle of Telamon of 225 BC heralded a gradual decline
                        of Gallic power over the 2nd century, until the eventual conquest of Gaul in the Gallic Wars
                        of the **50s BC** by Julius Caesar. After this, Gaul became a province of the Roman Empire,
                        and the Gauls were ethnically and culturally largely assimilated into Latin (Roman settlers)
                        majority, losing their tribal identities by the end of the 1st century AD.</p>

            <h2>Parthia<h2>
                    <h3>Basic Information</h3>
                    <p>The Parthian Empire (/ˈpɑːrθiən/; 247 BC – 224 AD), also known as the Arsacid Empire
                        (/ˈɑːrsəsɪd/), was a major Iranian political and cultural power in ancient Iran. Its
                        latter name comes from Arsaces I of Parthia who, as leader of the Parni tribe,
                        founded it in the mid-3rd century BC when he conquered the region of Parthia in
                        Iran's northeast, then a satrapy (province) under Andragoras, in rebellion against
                        the Seleucid Empire. Mithridates I of Parthia (r. c. 171–138 BC) greatly expanded
                        the empire by seizing Media and Mesopotamia from the Seleucids.</p>

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>At its height, the Parthian Empire stretched from the northern reaches of the
                        Euphrates, in what is now central-eastern Turkey, to eastern Iran. The empire,
                        located on the Silk Road trade route between the Roman Empire in the Mediterranean
                        Basin and the Han Empire of China, became a center of trade and commerce. The
                        earliest enemies of the Parthians were the Seleucids in the west and the Scythians
                        in the east. However, as Parthia expanded westward, they came into conflict with the
                        Kingdom of Armenia, and eventually the late Roman Republic. Rome and Parthia
                        competed with each other to establish the kings of Armenia as their subordinate
                        clients. The Parthians soundly defeated Marcus Licinius Crassus at the Battle of
                        Carrhae in 53 BC, and in 40–39 BC, Parthian forces captured the whole of the Levant
                        except Tyre from the Romans. However, Mark Antony led a counterattack against
                        Parthia, although his successes were generally achieved in his absence, under the
                        leadership of his lieutenant Ventidius. </p>

                    <h3>Conflict with Rome</h3>
                    <p>Various Roman emperors or their appointed generals invaded Mesopotamia in the course
                        of the ensuing Roman-Parthian Wars of the next few centuries. The Romans captured
                        the cities of Seleucia and Ctesiphon on multiple occasions during these conflicts,
                        but were never able to hold on to them. Frequent civil wars between Parthian
                        contenders to the throne proved more dangerous to the Empire's stability than
                        foreign invasion, and Parthian power evaporated when Ardashir I, ruler of Istakhr in
                        Persis, revolted against the Arsacids and killed their last ruler, Artabanus V, in
                        224 AD. Ardashir established the Sassanid Empire, which ruled Iran and much of the
                        Near East until the Muslim conquests of the 7th century AD, although the Arsacid
                        dynasty lived on through the Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia, the Arsacid dynasty of
                        Iberia, and the Arsacid Dynasty of Caucasian Albania; all eponymous branches of the
                        Parthian Arsacids.</p>
