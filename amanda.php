        <h1>Sustenance</h1>
        <p>While watermelons, tea and chocolate are all very different, they have in common the fact that they can be eaten or drunk for nourishment.  Therefore, the domain is Sustenance.  Things that fall under the category of sustenance have a number of different things in common, a few of which are described below in triples.  These are not all the relationships that define sustenance, but they will be the focus of this collection of information.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each piece of sustenance has a basic description of what it is for identification purposes</li>
            <li>Each piece of sustenance has a nutritional value</li>
            <li>Each piece of sustenance is processed to some degree (that degree may be minimal)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Watermelon<h2>
        <h3>Basic Description</h3>
        <p>Citrullus lanatus is a plant species in the family Cucurbitaceae, a vine-like (scrambler and trailer) flowering plant originating in West Africa. It is cultivated for its fruit. The subdivision of this species into two varieties, watermelons (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) var. lanatus) and citron melons (Citrullus lanatus var. citroides (L. H. Bailey) Mansf.), originated with the erroneous synonymization of Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai and Citrullus vulgaris Schrad. by L.H. Bailey in 1930.[2] Molecular data including sequences from the original collection of Thunberg and other relevant type material, show that the sweet watermelon (Citrullus vulgaris Schrad.) and the bitter wooly melon Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai are not closely related to each other.[3] Since 1930, thousands of papers have misapplied the name Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai for the watermelon, and a proposal to conserve the name with this meaning was accepted by the relevant nomenclatural committee and confirmed at the International Botanical Congress in Shenzhen.[4]</p>
        
        <h3>Nutritional Value</h3>
        <p>Watermelon fruit is 91% water, contains 6% sugars, and is low in fat (table).[50] In a 100 gram serving, watermelon fruit supplies 30 calories and low amounts of essential nutrients (table). Only vitamin C is present in appreciable content at 10% of the Daily Value (table). Watermelon pulp contains carotenoids, including lycopene.[51]  The amino acid citrulline is produced in watermelon rind.[52][53]</p>
        
        <h3>Processing</h3>
        <p>Watermelon is barely processed before consumption.  One merely cuts into the thick rind to get at the soft fruit underneath.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Tea<h2>
        <h3>Basic Description</h3>
        <p>Tea is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured leaves of the Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub (bush) native to East Asia.[3] After water, it is the most widely consumed drink in the world.[4] There are many different types of tea; some, like Darjeeling and Chinese greens, have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour,[5] while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral or grassy notes.</p>
        
        <h3>Nutritional Value</h3>
        <p>Without adding any milk or sugar, tea has 0 calories and provides no real nutritional value.  It has been claimed to have a lot of antioxidants though.</p>
        
        <h3>Processing</h3>
        <p>Teas of different levels of oxidation (L to R): green, yellow, oolong, and black. Tea is generally divided into categories based on how it is processed.[83] At least six different types are produced:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>White: wilted and unoxidized;</li>
            <li>Yellow: unwilted and unoxidized but allowed to yellow;</li>
            <li>Green: unwilted and unoxidized;</li>
            <li>Oolong: wilted, bruised, and partially oxidized;</li>
            <li>Black: wilted, sometimes crushed, and fully oxidized (called 紅茶 [hóngchá], "red tea" in Chinese tea culture);</li>
            <li>Post-fermented: green tea that has been allowed to ferment/compost (called 黑茶 [hēichá] "black tea" in Chinese tea culture).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After picking, the leaves of C. sinensis soon begin to wilt and oxidize unless immediately dried. An enzymatic oxidation process triggered by the plant's intracellular enzymes causes the leaves to turn progressively darker as their chlorophyll breaks down and tannins are released. This darkening is stopped at a predetermined stage by heating, which deactivates the enzymes responsible. In the production of black teas, halting by heating is carried out simultaneously with drying. Without careful moisture and temperature control during manufacture and packaging, growth of undesired molds and bacteria may make tea unfit for consumption.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Chocolate<h2>
        <h3>Basic Description</h3>
        <p>Chocolate is a usually sweet, brown food preparation of roasted and ground cacao seeds. It is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods. The earliest evidence of use traces to the Olmecs (Mexico), with evidence of chocolate beverages dating to 1900 BC.[1][2] The majority of Mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages, including the Maya and Aztecs.[3] Indeed, the word "chocolate" is derived from the Classical Nahuatl word chocolātl.[4]</p>
        
        <h3>Nutritional Value</h3>
        <p>A 100-gram serving of milk chocolate supplies 540 calories. It is 59% carbohydrates (52% as sugar and 3% as dietary fiber), 30% fat and 8% protein (table). Approximately 65% of the fat in milk chocolate is saturated, mainly palmitic acid and stearic acid, while the predominant unsaturated fat is oleic acid (table, see USDA reference for full report).  100-grams of milk chocolate is an excellent source (over 19% of the Daily Value, DV) of riboflavin, vitamin B12 and the dietary minerals, manganese, phosphorus and zinc. Chocolate is a good source (10–19% DV) of calcium, magnesium and iron.</p>
        
        <h3>Processing</h3>
        <p>Cacao pods are harvested by cutting them from the tree using a machete, or by knocking them off the tree using a stick. The beans with their surrounding pulp are removed from the pods and placed in piles or bins, allowing access to micro-organisms so fermentation of the pectin-containing material can begin. Yeasts produce ethanol, lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid, and acetic acid bacteria produce acetic acid. The fermentation process, which takes up to seven days, also produces several flavor precursors, eventually resulting in the familiar chocolate taste.[53]  It is important to harvest the pods when they are fully ripe, because if the pod is unripe, the beans will have a low cocoa butter content, or sugars in the white pulp will be insufficient for fermentation, resulting in a weak flavor. After fermentation, the beans must be quickly dried to prevent mold growth. Climate and weather permitting, this is done by spreading the beans out in the sun from five to seven days.[54]  The dried beans are then transported to a chocolate manufacturing facility. The beans are cleaned (removing twigs, stones, and other debris), roasted, and graded. Next, the shell of each bean is removed to extract the nib. Finally, the nibs are ground and liquefied, resulting in pure chocolate in fluid form: chocolate liquor.[55] The liquor can be further processed into two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter.[56]</p>
